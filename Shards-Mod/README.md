You are in the section off my GitHub where I've uploaded my Shards Mod update files. The files help with Auto-Updating. You can download the 'Shards Mod' file as it's the code for my mod. Rename it and add .modpkg to the end. Then just open it through the ModPE section on Minecraft Forum. Have Fun!

  THIS IS NOT WORKING IN THE MOD RIGHT NOW. I'M LEAVING THIS UP FOR YOU GUYS TO DOWNLOAD THE STUFF.
