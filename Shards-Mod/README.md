You are in the section of my GitHub where I've uploaded my Shards Mod update files. The files help with Auto-Updating. You can download the 'Shards Mod' file as it's the code for my mod. This does not include the texture pack and the mod WILL NOT work without them. Then just open it through the ModPE section on BlockLauncher. Have Fun!

  THIS IS NOT WORKING IN THE MOD RIGHT NOW. I'M LEAVING THIS UP FOR YOU GUYS TO DOWNLOAD THE STUFF.
